# Advent of Code. 2023

Just chilling, getting used to Rust language before attending to project or jobs (lol) in it.

Surely, I'd love to get some code review, but I guess, no one would be interested in some noname's code.
Idk, why am I writing it, bc no one in a sane mind would read it. Maybe, I just want to be like the cool kids from
YouTube and larping a little.

Hope, you feel great and your tea is warm.
